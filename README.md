# GymPal

A full-stack fitness and training platform with dedicated portals for clients and trainers. Built with React Native + Expo on the frontend and Node.js + Express on a Railway-hosted backend. Features real-time trainer sessions via Socket.IO, role-based auth, workout management, and lifestyle/intake tracking.

---

## Features

**Client portal**
- Dashboard with quick-access to all training modules
- Intake forms — body stats, goals, dietary preferences
- Lifestyle tracking — sleep, energy, activity logs
- Training plan viewer — assigned workouts with sets/reps
- Progress visualisation — charts built with `react-native-chart-kit`

**Trainer portal**
- Client overview — see all assigned clients and their status
- Workout builder — create and edit structured workout plans with exercises
- Global state management for real-time trainer ↔ client sync
- TV/Streaming mode — full-screen session view for in-gym display
- Socket.IO event handlers for live session updates

**Platform**
- JWT auth with role-based routing (client/trainer split at login)
- Session persistence via AsyncStorage
- Centralised Axios instance with automatic 401 logout handling
- Railway-hosted backend — always-on, no local server needed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- Expo Go app on your phone (or a simulator)

### Frontend setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GibbHubb/GymPal.git
cd GymPal
npm install
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go, or press `a` / `i` for Android / iOS simulator.

The app connects to the production Railway backend by default — no local server needed to run the frontend.

### Backend setup (local dev)

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your values
npm install
npm start              # runs on port 5000
```

Update `api.js` → `API_URL` to point at `http://localhost:5000/api` for local development.

#### Required environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | Server port (default: 5000) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing JWTs |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | Token lifetime (default: 7d) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` or `production` |

---

## Design System

All styling flows from `constants/Theme.js`. The Dark/Gold theme uses:

- **Background:** `#0D0D0D` — near-black surface
- **Accent:** `#F6B000` — GymPal Gold
- **Glass cards:** semi-transparent with blur for depth
- **Inputs:** transparent with gold underline/focus states
- **Typography:** consistent weight scale, white on dark

No third-party UI library — every component is hand-built to the spec.

## Offline-first Architecture

GymPal workouts are logged offline-first — they are always saved locally before any network call is attempted.

### Sync Queue (`utils/syncQueue.js`)

Each workout is persisted to `AsyncStorage` under the key `hai_sync_queue` as a JSON array of queue items. Every item carries:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Client-generated UUID v4 (used for idempotency) |
| `type` | Always `workout_log` |
| `payload` | Full workout body sent to the backend, including `client_id` |
| `status` | `pending` → `retrying` → `synced` / `failed` |
| `attempts` | Number of sync attempts so far |
| `createdAt` | ISO timestamp of local creation |

### Sync Engine (`utils/syncEngine.js`)

`startSyncEngine(apiBaseUrl, getAuthToken)` registers a `NetInfo` listener. When the device comes online it calls `runSync()` automatically. `runSync` can also be called manually (e.g. from a "Sync now" button).

**Retry policy:** up to 5 attempts with natural ordering (each connectivity event retries). After 5 failures the item is marked `failed` and not retried automatically.

### Idempotency

Each workout payload includes `client_id` (UUID). The backend `POST /api/workouts` route checks for an existing row with that `client_id` before inserting:

- Match found → returns `200` with the existing row (no duplicate).
- No match → inserts normally.

The required migration is at `backend/migrations/add_client_id_to_workout_logs.sql`.

### UI indicators

- **TrainingScreen** — shows a yellow badge for pending items, green for synced, red for sync failure.
- **ClientHome** — shows a red numeric badge on the Training button when there are unsynced workouts.
